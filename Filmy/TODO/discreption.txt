    i want to make a discord bot that have a DB (google drive , telegram , mongo , etc..) that can store films
    and tv serieses and display them in the discord thread to the user (using either embeds or some link that opens a player maybe a private thread etc..)

    commands :
        $filmList -> will display films
        $tvList -> will display tv serieses
        $filmName -> will send a link for filmName or maybe play it in another place


    #note : make it as simple and user friendly as possible and make it light with high perfomence
